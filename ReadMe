To ensure that your `server.js` application runs automatically after a reboot using PM2, you need to configure PM2 to start your application on system startup. Here are the steps to do that:

### Step 1: Install PM2
If you haven't already installed PM2 globally, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application with PM2
Navigate to your application directory and start your `server.js` file using PM2:

```bash
cd /root/youtube-streamer
pm2 start server.js --name "youtube-streamer"
```

### Step 3: Save the PM2 Process List
You need to save the current PM2 process list so that it can restore your applications on reboot:

```bash
pm2 save
```

### Step 4: Generate Startup Script
Next, you need to generate a startup script that PM2 can use to launch your applications after a reboot. Run the following command:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

This command will output a command that you need to run. It typically looks something like this:

```bash
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup linux -u <your-user> --hp /home/<your-user>
```

Make sure to replace `<your-user>` with your actual username if needed.

### Step 5: Run the Command
Copy and paste the command provided by the `pm2 startup` command into your terminal and run it. This sets up the necessary system service for PM2.

### Step 6: Verify the Configuration
To verify that your application will start on reboot, you can reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After your system comes back online, check the status of your PM2 applications with:

```bash
pm2 list
```

You should see your `youtube-streamer` application listed and running.

### Additional PM2 Commands
- To view logs for your application, use:
  ```bash
  pm2 logs youtube-streamer
  ```

- To stop the application, use:
  ```bash
  pm2 stop youtube-streamer
  ```

- To restart the application, use:
  ```bash
  pm2 restart youtube-streamer
  ```

### Summary
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully configure PM2 to run your `server.js` application automatically after a system reboot. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!























edit cookies and paste personal youtube cookies using extention google chrome

pm2 start server.js



Access the web panel: Open your browser and go to http://<your-server-ip>/ to manage your YouTube streams.

Important Notes
Ensure that you have valid YouTube session cookies added to the cookies.txt file for successful streaming.
The server listens on port 80, which may require root privileges to start. You might need to run the server with sudo if you're not running as root.
Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications!


Integrating PM2 with Your Setup Script
If you want to ensure PM2 is part of your existing setup script (setup.sh), you can add the following line after installing Node.js and npm:

bash
Copy code
# Install PM2 globally
sudo npm install -g pm2
This line should already be in the provided setup.sh script I shared earlier.

Running Your Application with PM2
If you want to start your server.js script using PM2, you can use:

bash
Copy code
pm2 start server.js --name youtube-streamer
Complete Setup
To set up PM2 in a complete environment, you can run your setup.sh script after ensuring it's executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
This will install PM2 and your application will start running under PM2's management.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!


























Instructions to Run the Script
Upload the Script: Use scp or any file transfer method to upload the install.sh script to your VPS.

Make the Script Executable: SSH into your server and navigate to the directory where you uploaded the script. Then run:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x install.sh
Run the Script: Execute the script with:

bash
Copy code
./install.sh
Start the Server: Once the installation is complete, navigate to the application directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/youtube-streamer
Then start the server (you will need sudo since port 80 requires elevated privileges):

bash
Copy code
sudo node server.js
Access the Web Panel: Open your web browser and go to http://your-server-ip to access the YouTube Stream Manager.

Important Note
Running on Port 80: Since port 80 is a privileged port, you need to run the server with sudo. Make sure you understand the security implications of running Node.js as root, especially if the server is exposed to the internet.
Conclusion
With these changes, your application will run on port 80, making it accessible without specifying a port in the URL. If you have further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!
