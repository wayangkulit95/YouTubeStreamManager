Instructions to Run the Script
Upload the Script: Use scp or any file transfer method to upload the install.sh script to your VPS.

Make the Script Executable: SSH into your server and navigate to the directory where you uploaded the script. Then run:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x install.sh
Run the Script: Execute the script with:

bash
Copy code
./install.sh
Start the Server: Once the installation is complete, navigate to the application directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/youtube-streamer
Then start the server (you will need sudo since port 80 requires elevated privileges):

bash
Copy code
sudo node server.js
Access the Web Panel: Open your web browser and go to http://your-server-ip to access the YouTube Stream Manager.

Important Note
Running on Port 80: Since port 80 is a privileged port, you need to run the server with sudo. Make sure you understand the security implications of running Node.js as root, especially if the server is exposed to the internet.
Conclusion
With these changes, your application will run on port 80, making it accessible without specifying a port in the URL. If you have further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!
